## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge mostly served to reinforce what I've already learned, but I did try something new That I would like to continue doing in the future.
I learned how to use helper classes to style components. It reminds me of how libraries like bootstrap function. Using classes like card\_\_category and button to apply general styles, then
applying specific styles allowed me to write less code and greatly simplify the project.

```html
<div class="card__category sedan">
  <p class="category__heading">Sedans</p>
  <p>
    Choose a sedan for its affordability and excellent fuel economy. Ideal for
    cruising in the city or on your next road trip.
  </p>
  <div class="button">Learn More</div>
</div>
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue this process of simplification wherever possible. I'd like to become proficient at visually breaking down layouts into reusable components.
